Vampire Team Fire Mission Logger

Check the latest release for the .APK to install on your Android device.

This allows the capture of Fox 1 or Fox 2 reports on your phone.  There is no internet required.

Every mission you save will be saved into a single file (.csv) for the day it is saved.  Fox 1s and Fox 2s are saved separately.

The saved files can be viewed and shared directly in the application.

They are saved in the .csv format, which allows easy import into Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or any spreadsheet application.
